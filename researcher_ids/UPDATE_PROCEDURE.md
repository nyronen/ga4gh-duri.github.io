## Specifications updates

The GA4GH Researcher Identities & Access Claims standard is established by members of the Data Use and Research Indentities (DURI) work stream. 

To suggest or initiate changes to the [specifications](http://bit.ly/ga4gh-ri-v1) please first contact the specification maintainers.

Prior to recommending changes please:
  * refer to the [landing page](https://github.com/ga4gh-duri/ga4gh-duri.github.io/tree/master/researcher_ids) for additional information about the purpose and use of the standard.
  * identify and provide the following information:
      1. Your name and affiliation
      2. If you are currently a member of GA4GH and in what capacity
      3. If you are currently using an implementation of RI Claims
      4. Whether you are recommending the change on behalf of one or more of the following: 
          * an implementation of the spec  
          * the RI Claims specification itself  
          * or other documentation in the researcher_ids directory  
      5. A full description of the recommendation you are making
      
A maintainer will get back to you shortly and may elect to raise your recommendation at the next RI Claims work stream meeting which typically occur every 4 weeks. 
The RI Claims specifications are a community driven project and we value your input.
